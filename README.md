# Avesd Core Monorepo

Avesd is the kiosk that grows with you: a local-first, extensible desktop
workspace that gains capabilities through replaceable plugins. The first
product is an Electron application; optional account and cloud capabilities can
be added later without becoming a dependency of the local workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Corepack
- pnpm 11.23.0 (pinned in `package.json`)

## Common commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm lint
pnpm compile
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm validate
```

The root pnpm scripts are the source of truth for repository tasks. Equivalent
Make targets provide short, stable entry points such as `make dev`,
`make validate`, and `make update-all`; running plain `make` performs no work.

Dependency maintenance commands:

- `pnpm depcheck` reports outdated dependencies across the workspace.
- `pnpm ud` updates within declared ranges and deduplicates the lockfile.
- `pnpm update-all` updates all workspace dependencies to their latest stable
  versions, updates referenced GitHub Actions, and deduplicates the lockfile.
- `pnpm iud` installs, updates within declared ranges, deduplicates, and updates
  the pinned pnpm version.

`pnpm lint` also validates repository boundaries, including catalog and
workspace dependency declarations, renderer privilege isolation, and the
runtime neutrality of public plugin and ACP contracts.

`pnpm test` runs fast Node.js unit tests and headless Chromium browser tests.
Browser tests use the `*.browser.test.ts` suffix and cover renderer plugin DOM
behavior; they do not replace Electron main/preload integration testing.
Before the first browser test run, install Chromium with
`pnpm --filter @avesd/desktop exec playwright install chromium`.

## Repository layout

- `apps/desktop` — Electron main, preload, and React renderer processes.
- `packages/acp-client` — provider-neutral ACP v1 client boundary.
- `packages/configuration` — shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Vitest defaults.
- `packages/kernel` — Cordis-backed plugin lifecycle adapter and contribution
  registries.
- `packages/plugin-api` — stable contracts implemented by plugins.
- `.agents/common-skills-policy.md` and `.agents/audit-policy.md` — local
  repository policy for globally installed shared skills.
- `working` — non-authoritative audits, plans, notes, and archived project
  memory.

## Runtime architecture

Avesd keeps a small trusted Electron host and moves product capabilities into
replaceable plugins. The internal runtime uses upstream Cordis, hidden behind
`@avesd/plugin-api`, so public plugins do not depend on the runtime framework.
Plugin registrations are reversible effects: activating a new version adds its
contributions first, then disposes the previous version in reverse registration
order. Failed activation removes only the candidate's effects, leaving the
previous version active.

Plugins interact with the host through two explicit surfaces on their activation
context. `contributions` publishes typed extension points such as workbench
views, while `services` contains only the storage, command, or external-opening
capabilities declared by the plugin and authorized by the host. The kernel binds
service scopes to the plugin identifier before activation, so plugin code cannot
select another plugin's service namespace. Concrete persistence and privileged
desktop implementations remain outside the runtime-neutral public API.

The renderer welcome screen is the first built-in UI plugin and participates in
Vite hot module replacement. External plugin discovery, compilation, sandboxing,
and persisted installation are intentionally not implemented yet.

AI harnesses connect through ACP. The client package owns protocol lifecycle and
capability negotiation while concrete process transports and account
authentication remain outside the protocol-neutral core.
